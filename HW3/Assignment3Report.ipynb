The line windowed_context = [chat_history[0]] + chat_history[-2:] only sees the last 2 question/answer pairs before the current one. After additional prompts were added in Trial B, the earlier message containing the vault code fell outside that window. As a result, the model had no access to that information when answering in Trial C, so it appeared to “forget” even though the data was still stored locally.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Trial C, the bot did not fully admit it lacked the information; instead, it tried to guess the code, showing mild hallucination and overconfidence. It suggested values like 0000 and even joked about alternatives such as Avogadro’s constant, which fit its comedic personality. This happens when the context window is too small: the model loses access to earlier conversation details but still tries to produce a confident and coherent response. Since LLMs are optimized to generate plausible text rather than explicitly saying “I don’t know,” they may fill in missing information by guessing when important context has been removed.\n",

In fact, the bot would not know how to act, and it might just act normal (spitting out facts by default) instead of having its own personality. Including it ensures that every response is generated with the intended personality and style. If we removed [system_msg] and only sent chat_history[-2:], the model would lose its behavioral instructions because those instructions would no longer be part of the prompt. As a result, the chatbot would likely respond in a more neutral, factual, or inconsistent way instead of maintaining a comedic persona.\n",
        "\n",
        "What if we want a smarter bot that remembers more? Repeat the above and explain if a window of 6 messages solves the problem\n",
        "\n",
        "As shown in Trial C when the context window was set to 6 messages instead of 2, the bot indeed remembered the code, and retained its personality by (politely) roasting the user to come up with a harder code to crack. This shows that we should increase the context window (due to other outside restrictions like computer RAM) if we want a “smarter” bot to retain more information given by the user. However, this does not completely solve the problem; it only delays forgetting. As conversations continue, older information will still eventually fall outside the window. In real-world systems, developers balance larger context windows with computational limits such as memory and cost. Modern models (e.g., Claude, Copilot, Gemini) use very large context windows so users can maintain longer conversations before information is lost. After all, models like Claude, CoPilot and Gemini have tens of thousands of messages they can remember.\n"

So, when you look at the Sun (which, please don't, I need you as an audience), you’re seeing it as it was eight minutes ago. It’s the only thing in the universe with a longer lag time than my 2012 MacBook.\n",
        "*   **A Magnetic Mess:** It has a magnetic field so complicated it makes a Rubik’s Cube look like a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Every 11 years, its poles flip.

Facts like “the Sun is a star” are built into the model, so it can answer that even if there is no conversation history loaded.\n",
        "However, it couldn’t remember what I said about the Sun because that depends on contextual memory, which only includes the messages from the current session. Since the Science and American History chats used different session_idvalues, the message I wrote in the Science session wasn’t loaded when I switched to the History session. So the bot still knew general facts, but it couldn’t access my specific earlier message.\n",

        "Session_id was a variable that stored each user’s session history with different ids so that it makes sure that each user’s chat history is local to only those sessions. For example, in this experiment the two types of sessions users could have were either  science facts or American history. However, since each of those 2 sessions had a unique id, the user’s questions (context memory) cannot be remembered from external sessions. I saw this in the experiment when I went to the American History session; it had no idea that I said anything about a sun in the Science Facts one. This prevents Context Pollution, the act of different sessions remembering the other’s information, and in the real-world, can prevent breach of privacy/confidentiality if a session holds such discreet information.\n"
